## Why?
Since the last few releases of PHP, all the elements for creating an
asynchronous environment are there -- all that is needed is an event loop system
and away we go. Evflow's goal is to not only define an interface for
implementing asynchronous functionality, but to provide a robust implementation
as well.

## Why asynchronous programming?
Some Very Smart People have shown that asynchronous programming takes the best
advantage of a system's resources in an efficient way. Asynchronous programming
doesn't replace threaded or multi-process systems, but rather compliments them.
It is a dynamic way of programming designed to minimize CPU time spent idling
and instead use the full capabilities of a computer's hardware and a real-time
operating systems' power.

## Why PHP?
Why not PHP? Riddle me *that*.
