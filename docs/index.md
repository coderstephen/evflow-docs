# Welcome to the Evflow documentation!
Evflow (/ˈɛvfloʊ/) is an open-source project with the goal of bringing powerful and extensible asynchronous programming features to vanilla PHP. It is taken from many lessons learned from other attempts at asynchronous programming in PHP and other languages as well. Much thanks is owed to the [ReactPHP](http://reactphp.org) team.

Evflow is currently an experiment and not recommended for production-level projects.

# Documentation status
If you can write documentation in a less humorous and more serious way than we can, we could use your help! This documentation is far from complete and we need to formally describe the architecture of the project before we move forward. Head over to the [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/evflow/evflow) to discuss the project and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/evflow/docs) to make changes to these docs.
